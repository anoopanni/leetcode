# Union-find is only for undirected graph; the data structure doesn't support it; when we say union(a, b) then it means a is connected to b and b is connected to a.
# Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the single source shortest path in a directed graph.
# Dijkstra's doesn't work for negative weights; Bellman Ford works for negative weights.

# Bellman Ford is used to find the single source shortest path in a directed graph and undirected graph with negative weights.
# Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with negative weights.
# Prim's algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree in an undirected graph with negative weights.


# Summary:

# Union-Find: Applicable for undirected graphs. Supports operations like union(a, b) to signify bidirectional connection between 'a' and 'b'.
# Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a single source in a directed graph without negative weights.
# Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Capable of finding the shortest path from a single source in directed or undirected graphs, including those with negative weights.
# Kruskal's Algorithm: Identifies the minimum spanning tree (MST) in an undirected graph; effective even with negative weights.
# Prim's Algorithm: Also calculates the MST in undirected graphs with negative weights.


# Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (which is called the "source node") and all other nodes in a graph.
